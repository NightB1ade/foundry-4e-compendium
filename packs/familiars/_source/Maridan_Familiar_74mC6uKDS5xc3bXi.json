In aquatic combat, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against nonaquatic creatures.</p><p><b>Active Benefits</b></p><p>Gift of Water:When you use an arcane daily attack power, each enemy adjacent to the maridan is slowed, and you (if you are adjacent to the maridan) and each ally adjacent to it gain partial concealment. These effects last until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Elemental Conduit: Once per encounter, you can use your familiar's space as the origin for a close arcane attack power.</p>",
