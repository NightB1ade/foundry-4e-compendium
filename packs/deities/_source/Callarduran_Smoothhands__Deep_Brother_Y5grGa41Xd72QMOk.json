He is a benign but secretive deity, caring only for his own people and their defense against drow and the other dangers of the Underdark. He intercedes to defend his followers from such dangers, and his appearance is heralded by a loud humming which can be heard through solid rock. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
