Once Garagos was an honored deity of war, a being associated more with military victory through fury than perseverance through sound tactical decisions. He eventually came into conflict with the young demigod Tempus, resulting in the Lord of Battle finally defeating Garagos by turning the Reaver's mindless fury against him. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
