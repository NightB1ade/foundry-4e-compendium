The Defiler of the Dead is always looking for ways to recruit new followers and disrupt the churches of other deities. Despite his loathsome nature, Sseth takes good care of his followers and does not willingly betray or abandon his people, as he finds it practical to maintain their loyalty. Sseth can be quite gracious and charming when first encountered, but he reveals his true colors very quickly. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80. </p>",
