The creature that would become known as the Wyrm of Avarice originally concerned himself with the natural beauty of gems and metals, but became estranged from his pantheon when Moradin named Dumathoin the patron of gold dwarves, a position Abbathor had coveted since birth. Thereafter he traded the tradition and honor of the dwarven race for trickery and stealth. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
