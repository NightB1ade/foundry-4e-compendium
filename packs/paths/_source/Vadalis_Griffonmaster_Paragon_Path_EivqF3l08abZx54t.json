			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ranger, Beast Mastery class feature, Mark of Handling feat </p><p>In the final years of the Last War, House Vadalis began training griffon riders-soldiers mounted on domesticated griffons. As a Vadalis griffonmaster, you had a hand in training those griffons and their riders. With your dragon mark's power, you've become an expert rider who is at home on the back of a griffon. </p><p><b>VADALIS GRIFFONMASTER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Griffonmaster Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, your Vadalis-bred griffon can take a standard action or a move action after your attack. If the griffon uses the action to attack, the attack deals 1d6 extra damage. </p><p><b>Vadalis Griffon (11th level)</b></p><p>You can swap your current beast companion for a Vadalis-bred griffon. </p><p><b>Vadalis Ritual Techniques (16th level)</b></p><p>You have mastered and can perform the Commune with Nature and Phantom Steed rituals as if you had the Ritual Caster feat. </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 79. </p>",
