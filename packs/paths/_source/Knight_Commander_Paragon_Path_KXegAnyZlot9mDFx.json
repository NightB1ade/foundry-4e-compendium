			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord, proficiency with heavy armor </p><p>Your path as a warlord has led you to assume the status of a knight commander, an armored epitome of leadership and combat who has no fear of leading from the front-and who has the requisite skills and abilities to handle that responsibility. You inspire by example, you press every offensive, and you rally your allies with powerful attacks and stirring tactics. </p><p><b>KNIGHT COMMANDER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Honor and Glory (11th level)</b></p><p>Allies gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls while adjacent to you. </p><p><b>Knight Commander's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, your allies gain a +1 bonus to all defenses until the start of your next turn. To gain this bonus, an ally has to see and hear you when you spend the action point. </p><p><b>Press of Arms (16th level)</b></p><p>When you or an ally within 3 squares of you makes an opportunity attack, that attacker gains a bonus to the damage roll. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 154, Class Compendium. </p>",
