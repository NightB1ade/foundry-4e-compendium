In addition, you examine the strands of fate to issue proclamations of doom to all who stand against you. </p><p><b>DOOMSAYER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Doomsayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also deal the extra damage of your Warlock's Curse to all of your enemies currently affected by it. Doing so does not prevent you from dealing your Warlock's Curse damage another time this turn. </p><p><b>Doomsayer's Proclamation (11th level)</b></p><p>Enemies within 10 squares of you must roll two dice when rolling saving throws against fear effects. They must use the lower of the two rolls. </p><p><b>Doomsayer's Oath (16th level)</b></p><p>When you are bloodied, you gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls when you use a power that has the fear keyword. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 140, Class Compendium. </p>",
