			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden </p><p>You are part of a tradition that considers the north wind to be your spiritual parent, and you revere the spirits that first breathed life into the world. Members of your tradition can be found wherever the north wind blows. </p><p>As a child of the north wind, you are a pillar of strength in your party, your courage as unceasing as a gale. When you are embattled, you call on the ferocity of windstorms to aid your attacks. When your ire is aroused, the air might gust around you, just as the strongest winds might fall silent in response to your calm. </p><p><b>CHILD OF THE NORTH WIND PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>North Wind Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a benefit until the end of your next turn: When you hit any enemy, you either deal 5 extra damage to that enemy or knock it prone. </p><p><b>North Wind Vortex (11th level)</b></p><p>When you reduce any enemy to 0 hit points, you slide each enemy marked by you 1 square as a free action. </p><p><b>Staggering Critical (16th level)</b></p><p>When you score a critical hit with a melee attack, each enemy marked by you is knocked prone. </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 107. </p>",
