			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Barbarian (berserker) </p><p>You have battled your way out of the dangerous wilderness, faced ever-growing threats, and managed to keep yourself alive despite your occasional recklessness. You grow stronger both in your connection to the primal spirits and in your martial prowess. This marriage of power makes you a dangerous and skilled warrior when in control of your emotions, and a force of nature when you give in to your rage. </p><p><b>DEADLY BERSERKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Berserker's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make a melee weapon attack, you deal 1d12 extra damage to each target you hit with that attack. </p><p><b>Reaping Fury (11th level)</b></p><p>While you are under the effect of your Berserker Fury class feature, whenever you miss with a weapon using an at-will attack power or an encounter attack power, you gain a power bonus to the damage roll of your next weapon attack that hits before the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Strength modifier. </p><p><b>Supreme Stamina (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever your attack drops a nonminion enemy to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + one-half your level. </p><p>Published in Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 116. </p>",
