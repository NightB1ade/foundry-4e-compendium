As an astral weapon, there are no enemies you won't oppose, no challenge you won't take on, for your faith is strong and your weapon sings with power from on high. When you accept this path, the weapon you wield forevermore glows with the silvery light of the Astral Sea. </p><p><b>ASTRAL WEAPON PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Astral Judgment (11th level)</b></p><p>Enemies currently marked by you that attack your allies without attacking you take a -2 penalty to all defenses until they are no longer marked by you. </p><p><b>Astral Rejuvenation Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to regain one paladin encounter power you have already used, instead of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Courage from on High (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against fear effects. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 100. </p>",
