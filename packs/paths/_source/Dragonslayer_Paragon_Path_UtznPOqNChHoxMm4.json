			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin </p><p>A champion must fight many monsters, and the most savage and ferocious of these are dragons. They sport a daunting arsenal of claws, fangs, stings, roars, and breath weapons, and they are protected by iron-hard scales and supernatural vitality. Many also have a wicked, calculating intelligence. Few warriors stand a chance against such foes, but you have made it your duty to protect defenseless folk against their depredations. You seek out all destructive monsters-including other fantastic beasts such as manticores, wyverns, and sphinxes-and put an end to their reigns of terror. </p><p>You might be a hunter of some skill, but you do not rely on patient stalking, trap-setting, or sudden ambush to defeat your sworn enemies. You meet monsters openly in chivalrous combat, pitting your skill and courage against fiery breath and flashing fang. It's a fair fight. </p><p><b>DRAGONSLAYER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dragonslayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a +2 bonus to all defenses against creatures marked by you. This bonus lasts until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Dragonslayer's Challenge (11th level)</b></p><p>The first time you mark a target during an encounter, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls against that target until that mark ends. The bonus increases to +4 at 21st level. </p><p><b>True Heart (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Will against fear effects. </p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 97. </p>",
