			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Mark of Passage feat </p><p>Among the best duelists of House Orien are the swiftblades, peerless swordmasters whose Marks of Passage enable them to cut paths between worlds with their flashing blades. As a swiftblade, you can slice a rift in the fabric of the world, dart through it, and then appear on the other side of the battle field. When you practice against your peers, the fights range across neighborhoods and cities as you and your opponent teleport from place to place. </p><p>House Orien calls upon swiftblades to defend the house's interests with weapon and word. The house dispatches the duelists to conduct negotiations or investigate disturbances in its travel network. With their sophisticated demeanor, swiftblades are often underestimated by House Orien's enemies. Those who attract the ire of an Orien swiftblade quickly learn that the duelists are more than casual weaponmasters. </p><p><b>ORIEN SWIFTBLADE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Swiftblade Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point, you can teleport your speed as a move action until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Vigilant Sprinter (11th level)</b></p><p>You do not grant combat advantage for running. </p><p><b>Swift Foot (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to speed and a +1 bonus to AC and to Reflex against opportunity attacks. </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 74. </p>",
