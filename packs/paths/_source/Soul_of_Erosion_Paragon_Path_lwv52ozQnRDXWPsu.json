			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Genasi, causticsoul elemental manifestation, watersoul elemental manifestation </p><p>The soul of erosion combines the two most insinuating elements: water and its destructive cousin acid. Those who pursue this path perfect a devastating fighting style that sweeps foes aside even as it sears them. </p><p>Some genasi who follow this path consider the union of water with its Abyssal analogue a measured balance of the natural and the unnatural. Others think of it as diluting their corruption with purity, and cruel minds consider it tainting the purity of the watersoul with the bile of the Abyss. All you know is that, whatever anyone else thinks, your abilities get the job done. </p><p><b>SOUL OF EROSION PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Erosion Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can shift half your speed before or after the action. Each enemy adjacent to you at any point during that move takes 5 acid damage. </p><p><b>Union of Blessed and Cursed Waters (11th level)</b></p><p>You manifest both watersoul and causticsoul at the same time when you manifest either one. This feature allows you to use both swiftcurrent and acid surge in the same encounter. </p><p><b>Flowing Movement (16th level)</b></p><p>You are insubstantial while you are moving. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 380, page(s) 23. </p>",
