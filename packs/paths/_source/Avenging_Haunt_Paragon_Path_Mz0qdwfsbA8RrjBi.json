			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Revenant </p><p>Death frees souls from the concerns of life, but some wrongs the departed remember-even if the mind has long rotted away. You're the ghost of a life you barely recall; yet, you can't forget what they did. And you won't forgive it either. Some power put you back in this world, and whether or not it did so for this reason, you're out for revenge. Of course, those who wronged you in the past aren't the only ones on your hit list. You received a second chance, and this time you're not letting anything slide. </p><p>With each enemy you bury, you feel a little hollower. The cold rage gives way to a numbing chill, and life-your previous one and the half-life you now lead-slips quietly away into oblivion. Still, what difference does it make? You're already dead. </p><p><b>AVENGING HAUNT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Ghostly Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point, you gain phasing and insubstantial until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Death Reprisal (12th level)</b></p><p>When an enemy's attack reduces you to 0 or fewer hit points, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Unkillable (16th level)</b></p><p>Your Unnatural Vitality racial feature allows you to stay conscious until you die. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 43. </p>",
