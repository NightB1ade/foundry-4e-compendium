			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord </p><p>You are a veteran of many battles, and it shows. You have learned tricks and techniques that can be picked up only on the field of battle, and you have learned more than just how to survive-you have learned how to win. Moreover, your combat skills and innate leadership translate to those who fight beside you. You make those around you better, and your allies are happy to have you fighting at their side. </p><p><b>COMBAT VETERAN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Combat Veteran's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, one of your allies within 10 squares of you can take a move action as a free action. </p><p><b>Tough as Nails (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain an extra healing surge. In addition, whenever you spend a healing surge to regain hit points, add your Constitution modifier to the hit points you regain. </p><p><b>Battle Healer (16th level)</b></p><p>When you use your inspiring word, the target can also make a saving throw. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 154, Class Compendium. </p>",
