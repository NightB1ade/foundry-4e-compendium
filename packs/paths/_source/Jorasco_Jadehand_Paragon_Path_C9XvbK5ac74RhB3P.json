			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Mark of Healing feat </p><p>When Sahemi the Emissary told House Jorasco that it should help heal Eberron from the wounds of the Last War, you listened. Despite resistance from much of the house, Sahemi insisted that the dragon mark that he and his kin bore mandated an effort to help heal the land. A supporter of Sahemi's efforts, you call yourself a jadehand for the jade bracelets you wear in emulation of the Emissary. You respect the druidic traditions, and you're interested in stopping supernal menaces and healing the world's scars, such as the Mournland. You have a broad view of what constitutes \"healing,\" so you also apply your skills liberally to help heal people and the land. For you, exposing a demonic cult and thwarting frontier banditry are just incisions and surgeries performed on a larger scale. </p><p><b>JORASCO JADEHAND PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Improved Recovery (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you grant an ally a saving throw, that ally can roll two dice and take the higher result. </p><p><b>Jadehand Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to use a healing power, you restore extra hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. </p><p><b>Healing Savant (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you use a healing power during a short or an extended rest, that power restores the maximum number of hit points possible. </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 70. </p>",
