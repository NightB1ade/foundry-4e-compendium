In the tireless turns of the dervish dance, the cares and distractions of the mortal world fall away, allowing you to perceive divine truths. </p><p>There are a number of dervish traditions, and not all dervishes are avengers; most are priests and scholars of desert peoples. Dervishes of the dawn represent a tradition celebrating the mystic power of the sunrise and venerating gods of hope and enlightenment. As a dervish of dawn, you are an agent of hope, a wandering mystic given the sacred task of fighting oppression and despair and setting an example of piety wherever you travel. </p><p><b>DERVISH OF DAWN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Celerity of Morning (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also make a saving throw with a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier. </p><p><b>Radiant Blessing (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use an encounter or a daily attack power that has the radiant keyword, you gain a +2 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Dervish Ecstasy (16th level)</b></p><p>If you are bloodied during an encounter, you can use a second Channel Divinity power in that encounter. </p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 21. </p>",
