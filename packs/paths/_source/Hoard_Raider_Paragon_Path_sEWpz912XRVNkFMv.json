			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Rogue </p><p>The world contains few sources of wealth greater than a dragon's hoard. While most consider it suicide to target a hoard for theft, some rogues consider these targets the ultimate challenge. You count yourself among these thrillseekers, \"liberating\" gold and magic items from the lairs of great dragons, and possibly leaving a dead dragon in your wake as well. </p><p><b>HOARD RAIDER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dragon-Slayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to reroll an attack roll against a dragon, or to end a condition currently affecting you that originated from a dragon, and that a save can end. Using this feature replaces the normal action point benefit of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Gap in the Armor (11th level)</b></p><p>When you score a critical hit against a creature you have combat advantage against, you deal an additional 1d6 damage. If this creature is a dragon, you instead deal an additional 2d6 damage. </p><p><b>Flank the Beast (16th level)</b></p><p>While you are flanking an enemy, you gain a +1 bonus to AC against that creature's attacks. If that enemy is a dragon, you instead gain a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex against that creature's attacks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 50. </p>",
