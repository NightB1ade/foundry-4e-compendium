			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Invoker, Covenant of Wrath class feature </p><p>You walk a perilous path, for you study the rare and dangerous fragments of the Compact Infernal. Through your understanding of this dark lore, you have harnessed the power of the Nine Hells. You hold mastery over infernal conflagrations and can conjure fiendish servants. With such power at your command, you run the risk of becoming consumed by pride and being seduced by fell whispers. You must use your powers with great care-if you falter, the fiends that serve you might become your masters. </p><p><b>THEURGE OF THE COMPACT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Bringer of Despair (11th level)</b></p><p>When you score a critical hit with an invoker attack power, you can take 5 damage. If you do so, the target of the critical hit takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls (save ends). </p><p><b>Incendiary Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, each target hit by that attack gains vulnerable 5 fire until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Fiery Wrath (16th level)</b></p><p>The bonus damage of your Covenant Manifestation is fire and is 2 instead of 1 for each enemy. </p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 78. </p>",
