			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid </p><p>You have mastered the form of the coiled serpent, a sleek, stealthy beast form that carries the promise of pain and poison for your enemies. Some druids keep their distance from serpentine beasts, but you recognize such creatures as being just as integral to the natural world as anything that has fur or feathers. You call on cold-eyed serpent spirits, and your connection to the cobra, the adder, and the python gives you a subtle magic. </p><p>As a coiled serpent, you gain abilities that let you grab creatures, deal poison damage, and move swiftly. </p><p><b>COILED SERPENT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Serpent Form (11th level)</b></p><p>While you are in beast form, you gain resist 15 poison and a +5 bonus to Stealth checks. The resistance increases to 20 at 21st level. </p><p><b>Snake Fang Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, each target hit by that attack takes ongoing 10 poison damage (save ends). </p><p><b>Serpent's Poison (16th level)</b></p><p>When you hit with a melee attack while you are in beast form, the attack deals 2d6 extra poison damage. </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 53. </p>",
