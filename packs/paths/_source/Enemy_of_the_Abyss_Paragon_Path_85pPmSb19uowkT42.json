			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Genasi, corrupt manifestation </p><p>Despite the petty discrimination that Abyssal genasi endure, they make their own way through the world. Some flourish; many falter. A few look beyond the unpleasantness of the world to the true cause of their pain: the Abyss. </p><p>You have declared war on the source of your corruption, but you do not deny the power that the Abyss has granted you. Instead, you have decided to seize as much of the Abyss's power as you can grasp, and will turn this power back on its source, wielding it against the forces of the Abyss. </p><p><b>ENEMY OF THE ABYSS PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Abyssal Blood Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action and you are bloodied, any enemy within 3 squares of you takes ongoing 5 damage (save ends), and you gain regeneration 5 until no enemy has ongoing damage from this feature. </p><p><b>Steal from the Abyss (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use your corrupt manifestation racial power, you gain a +2 bonus to your next attack roll, and each demon within 10 squares of you takes a -2 penalty to its next attack roll. </p><p><b>Abyssal Presence (16th level)</b></p><p>You ignore the resistances of demons within 5 squares of you. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 380, page(s) 21. </p>",
