			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden </p><p>As an emerald guardian, you are nature's stalwart protector, wandering the world in search of corruption and purging it. You and your fellow guardians staunchly oppose those who bend magic to sinister ends, and much of your efforts are dedicated to containing such threats. You seek to restore the balance that is central to the prosperity of all living things. </p><p>The primal power of life infuses an emerald guardian. Wherever you go, blight fades, flowers blossom, and the power of nature is reinvigorated. As an emerald guardian, you lend this healing presence to your allies, helping them withstand enemy attacks. </p><p><b>EMERALD GUARDIAN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Distracting Action (Emerald Guardian) (11th level)</b></p><p><b>Primal Blessing (11th level)</b></p><p>When you succeed on a saving throw at the start of your turn, one ally adjacent to you can make a saving throw with a +2 bonus. </p><p><b>Emerald Fury (16th level)</b></p><p>When you hit an enemy with your warden's fury power, you push that enemy 3 squares, and then one ally adjacent to that enemy gains 10 temporary hit points. </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 109. </p>",
