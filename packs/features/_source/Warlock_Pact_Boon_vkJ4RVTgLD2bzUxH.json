			"value":"<p>You gain the Pact Boon associated with your Eldritch Pact.</p>\n<p>To select this option, you must have selected the at-will attack power associated with your pact. If you later retrain that power, you lose the benefit of this option.</p>\n<p>Suggested Combinations</p>\n<p>A sorcerer/warlock can be a potent striker, with Charisma as the highest ability score.</p>\n<p>Combining the warlock with the wizard creates a synergistic power list, and the wizard's key ability, Intelligence, is a good secondary ability for the warlock.</p>\n<p>A combination of warlock and bard works quite well, thanks to the ability score overlap of the two classes and the diversity of their power selection.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 153.</p>",
