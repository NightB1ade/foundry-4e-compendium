			"value":"<p>You increase your Charisma by 2, and your origin becomes immortal. </p><p>In addition, you gain a shakti, an ancient tool of the Reigar that takes the form of a small statuette or token that is representative of you. As a minor action, you can transform it into a +5 magic weapon, magic implement, magic armor, or amulet of protection (+6 at 26th level). If the shakti leaves your person or is destroyed somehow, it turns to dust. You can create it again as a minor action, and it appears on your person in the desired form. </p>",
