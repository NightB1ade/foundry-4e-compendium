			"value":"<p>Once per encounter as a minor action, you can designate the enemy nearest to you as a worthy foe until the end of the encounter. Until the start of your next turn, your attacks against the worthy foe ignore any resistance and the insubstantial quality. </p><p>In addition, once per round, you can deal 2d8 extra damage to the worthy foe on a hit. If you can make multiple attacks against the worthy foe during your turn, you decide which attack to apply the extra damage to after all the attacks are rolled. </p><p>Finally, if you reduce the worthy foe to 0 hit points, you can spend a healing surge as a free action. </p>",
