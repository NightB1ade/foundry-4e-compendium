You heal to half your maximum hit points and gain concealment against all attacks until the end of the encounter. If you die while in the form of your future self, you're dead. </p><p>At the end of the encounter, your future self restores you to life if your body is still present. Your current hit point total is unchanged, and you no longer have concealment. </p><p>If your body is missing, you will need other magic to return to life, but you can continue adventuring as your future self if you would like to do so. </p>",
