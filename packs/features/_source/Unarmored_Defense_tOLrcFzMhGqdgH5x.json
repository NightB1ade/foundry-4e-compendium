			"value":"<p>While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren't using a shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.</p>\n<p>Full Discipline</p>\n<p>Many monk powers have the full discipline keyword. A full discipline power gives you two or more actions to choose from, usually an attack technique and a movement technique. Attack techniques usually require a standard action, and movement techniques are options for your move actions. For a monk, a full discipline power represents a fighting style, a unique combination of a move and an attack.</p>\n<p>You can use only one full discipline power per round. However, if you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can switch to a different full discipline power. You can use the techniques of a full discipline power in whatever order you like, and you can choose to use one of the techniques and not the other during a particular round.</p>\n<p>The number of times you can use a full discipline power's techniques during a round is determined by the power's type-at-will or encounter-and by the actions you have available that round. For example, you can use the techniques of an at-will full discipline power as many times during a round as you like, provided you have enough of the required actions, but you can use the techniques of an encounter full discipline power once during a round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
