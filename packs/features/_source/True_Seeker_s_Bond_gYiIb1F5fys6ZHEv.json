			"value":"<p>You gain the rest of the benefits of the Seeker's Bond option you chose (except that you can still use the power only once per day).</p>\n<p>Suggested Combinations</p>\n<p>The best hybrid combination for this class is ranger/seeker, creating a ranged attack specialist. Your Wisdom and Dexterity scores should be equally high, with Strength a good third choice.</p>\n<p>The rogue/seeker can pick up ranged attacks from both classes, using thrown daggers or a hand crossbow rather than a longbow. Ability score assignment is difficult; you'll need high Wisdom and Dexterity scores, and your secondary ability options require some tough choices.</p>\n<p>The fighter/seeker can be a mighty warrior. Strength and Wisdom should be your top ability scores.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 150.</p>",
