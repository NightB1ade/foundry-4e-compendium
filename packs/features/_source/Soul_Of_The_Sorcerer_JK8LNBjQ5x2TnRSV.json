You gain that class feature, and you are considered to have the associated Spell Source for the purpose of meeting prerequisites and using the benefits tailored for it in certain powers.</p>\n<p>Suggested Combinations</p>\n<p>One can easily imagine a young sorcerer turning to an Eldritch Pact to gain access to even greater power. Indeed, the sorcerer/warlock is a potent striker who has a variety of attacks, though the classes' secondary abilities don't match up well.</p>\n<p>Add the hybrid bard to your hybrid sorcerer to gain healing powers and to heighten your character's reputation as a valorous trickster.</p>\n<p>A rogue/sorcerer gains some useful melee attack powers, as long as he or she favors Dexterity.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 151.</p>",
