			"value":"<p>This class feature functions as the avenger class feature, except that you start with a single avenger Channel Divinity power of your choice.</p>\n<p>Suggested Combinations</p>\n<p>The avenger/invoker enjoys a variety of melee and nonmelee attacks, all based on Wisdom. You can control enemies at a distance, making it even easier for you to hunt down your prey.</p>\n<p>The avenger/wizard seems like an unusual combination at first glance, but both classes suggest the study of secret lore. With good Wisdom and Intelligence scores, you can achieve the same variety of attacks as an avenger/invoker can.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 140.</p>",
