Focus on ranged implement attacks when choosing bard powers.</p>\n<p>A bard/paladin can mix leadership and defense and maintain accuracy with Charisma attack powers. You'll need a little help with AC, particularly if you're the only defender in the group.</p>\n<p>Combining a bard with a warlord can create a leader who has powers that move allies and enemies around the battlefield with ease.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 141.</p>",
