			"value":"<p>You have a battlefist, which replaces your hand. The battlefist is a melee weapon with which you are proficient. It is a part of the mace weapon group, deals 1d8 damage, and has a +3 proficiency bonus. You can hold items in your battlefist as though it were your hand, but you must not be holding anything when you use your battlefist as a weapon. You can use the Enchant Magic Item, Disenchant Magic Item, and Transfer Enchantment rituals on the battlefist. Using Disenchant Magic Item on the battlefist does not destroy it. </p>",
