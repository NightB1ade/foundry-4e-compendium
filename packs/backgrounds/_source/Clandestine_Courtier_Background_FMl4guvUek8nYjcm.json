			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>House Thuranni </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>To the gossip traders in Khorvaire's noble courts, you were just another Thuranni hanger-on, possessed of enough money and personal magnetism to make you a welcome guest at noble courts across the land, often for months at a time. But your masters in House Thuranni knew the truth: You were engaged in espionage at every stop on the social calendar. The secrets you learned in Aundair in summer were sold to the highest bidder in Karrnath before the leaves fell-or better yet, exchanged for even more valuable secrets. At what courts did you linger as you made the circuit from manor to manor? Did you have to deal with rivalsfrom House Phiarlan? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Insight </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 157. </p>",
