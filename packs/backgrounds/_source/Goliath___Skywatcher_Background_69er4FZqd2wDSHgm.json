You helped your people avoid overhunting and overharvesting, scouted new territory, and oversaw seasonal celebrations. Now you are separated from your tribe, either by choice or by necessity. What happened? Did you make a decision that earned you bitter enemies in your tribe? Did a younger member rise to favor over you? Or did you feel a call to the world beyond your tribal lands? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Religion </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 182. </p>",
