Your parents were half-elves, and the mingling of elf and human blood in your veins goes back generations. Why did this community form? Did your people face prejudice from humans, elves, or both? Or have you had almost no contact with either race until now? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 182. </p>",
