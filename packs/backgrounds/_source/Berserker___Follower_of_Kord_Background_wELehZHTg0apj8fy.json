			"value":"<p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Follower of Kord </p><p>You can't help it. When anger overtakes you, a crimson haze fills your vision, and the rage you hold tightly within you breaks free of your control. Your people call you a berserker, and among them you are both honored and feared. When you go berserk and spittle flecks your mouth, you know nothing of fear-you feel at least twice as strong and every sense seems heightened. Worship of Kord seemed as natural as a sailor praying to Melora. </p><p>How did you first learn you are a berserker? Do you see it as a blessing or a curse? What are your people like? Does your family have a berserker tradition, or are you an anomaly? Is your faith in Kord in gratitude for this gift, or do you hope to endure and overcome it? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Perception </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 392. </p>",
