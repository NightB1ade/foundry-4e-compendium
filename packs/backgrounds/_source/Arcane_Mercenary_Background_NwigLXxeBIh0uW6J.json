			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Society </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You work for pay. You'll take coin if that's all your patron has to offer, but you prefer to be paid in magic. Magic items, magical lore, magical secrets-you value these more than gold. </p><p>More than any other form of payment, you want an artifact. Gaining an artifact is your goal. You might even have a specific artifact in mind. </p><p>You recognize that artifacts, as magical quasientities with temperaments and goals all their own, cannot be bought and sold by gold. That knowledge only stokes your burning desire to possess one. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, History </p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 159. </p>",
