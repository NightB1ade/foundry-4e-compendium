That is, until you met Liria Valthorin. Disarmed and with her sword at your throat, she offered you training at her school, the House of Flowers, instead of death. Did you duel for money, fame, or some other reason? Are you a young hotshot, still building your reputation, or is this a new chapter in a long career? Do you consider Liria a teacher, friend, or rival? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Acrobatics, Insight </p><p>Associated Languages: Elven </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 386, page(s) 65. </p>",
