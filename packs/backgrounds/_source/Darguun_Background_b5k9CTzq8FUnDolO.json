			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>Depending upon one's point of view, Darguun is either the strong rightful heir of a defeated land, or it's a scab growing over the wounds of deception and deceit. A nation of warriors built on the ruins of Cyran settlements, Darguun was born less than three decades ago in a single moment of betrayal. A harsh, dangerous land, Darguun still struggles to determine precisely what sort of nation it is-and what kind it will become. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Endurance </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 133. </p>",
