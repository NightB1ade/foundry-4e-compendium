Did you follow a mortal demagogue, or was the cult dedicated to some magical creature or supernatural threat? Was the cult nefarious or simply misguided? How did you escape the cult and find your way? Does the cult still exist, or was it crushed or dispersed? Do you still secretly believe the cult's teachings, or do you hunger for revenge against those who lied to you? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Stealth, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 128. </p>",
