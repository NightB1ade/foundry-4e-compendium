One should deny the individual and embrace one's place as part of a larger whole. You studied this philosophy for a time. Do you still subscribe to it, or did you abandon it? What attracted you to it in the first place? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Acrobatics, Insight </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 164. </p>",
