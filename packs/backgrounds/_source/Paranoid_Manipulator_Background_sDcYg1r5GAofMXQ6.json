If your power were to be discovered, you would not long survive the vengeance of your kin. How successfully did you learn to discern friends from enemies? Did you consistently misdirect and elude those who would do you harm? Or were you forced to flee your home one step ahead of the blades that you know are seeking for you still? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Perception </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 122. </p>",
