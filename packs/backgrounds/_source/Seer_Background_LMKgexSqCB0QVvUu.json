Were you a fake, or did you have a genuine talent? If the latter, how do your visions manifest? Choosing this background does not let you consistently perceive the future, but it does provide the DM with a tool for starting adventures and as a way to feed you information you might have missed. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Bluff </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 380, page(s) 57. </p>",
