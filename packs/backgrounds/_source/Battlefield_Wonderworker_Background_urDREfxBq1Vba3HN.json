			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Occupation </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Eladrin, artificer </p><p>Even at an early age, your aptitude for arcane magic differed from that of your peers. Instead of pouring over dusty tomes or practicing with your blade, you tinkered with constructs of your own design or experimented with alchemical reagents. After completing your studies, you joined the military to seek excitement and test your skills. However, you quickly became disillusioned with a military dominated by haughty wizards and swordmages, and you left to pursue a career as an adventurer. </p><p>Were you jealous of the advantages typically reserved for your wizard and swordmage peers? Did you wish to emulate them or did you defiantly pursue your own interests? How did your attitude affect your studies and subsequent career? What finally prompted you to leave the military? Did you leave of your own accord or in disgrace? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Athletics </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 390. </p>",
