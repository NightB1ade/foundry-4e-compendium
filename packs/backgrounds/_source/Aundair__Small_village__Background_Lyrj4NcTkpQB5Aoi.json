			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>Aundair is two nations in one. Pastoral villages and farmlands line its borders or cluster around the keeps of the region's feudal lords. The people here aresimple, even rustic. The nation's great cities, however, are alive with commerce and bustle with a crowd nearly as cosmopolitan as that of Sharn. The houses of government and institutions of higher learning nearly burst with the learned, the scholarly, and the magically inclined. Yet whether one is listening to scholars or farmers, mages or laborers, Aundairians speak of their nation with pride. They are unified in their identity, and they don't care how greatly their customs and preferences vary. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Nature </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 124. </p>",
