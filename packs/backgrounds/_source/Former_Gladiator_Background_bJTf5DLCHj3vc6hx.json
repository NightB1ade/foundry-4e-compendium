What sorts of gladiatorial spectacles did you take part in: individual combats, staged mass battles, gladiator-vs.-monster fights, or inherently unfair gladiator punishments (like unarmed prisoners against beasts)? And what kept you going? The whips of your masters, the lure of competition, or the roar of the crowd? </p><p>Good Background: Fighter. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>It takes four failed death saves to kill you. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 58. </p>",
