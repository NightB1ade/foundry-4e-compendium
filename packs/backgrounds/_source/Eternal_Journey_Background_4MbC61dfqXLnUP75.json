This is a mindset, to be sure, but it has prevented you from finding a place in your community. Thus you set out to find the meaning you seek in a world that is strange and often unfriendly. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Endurance </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 389, page(s) 27. </p>",
