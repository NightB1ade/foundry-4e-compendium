			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Deva, Psionic </p><p>Accustomed to thinking in terms of souls and past lives, many devas subscribe to the \"collective sentience\" theory of psionics origin. Some devas additionally theorize that psionics draws not only on the minds of living beings, but on the thoughts of all sentient creatures that have ever lived. You believe that your psionic abilities are derived, in part, from the thoughts, dreams, and ambitions of your prior incarnations and angelic ancestors. But do you feel obligated to honor your forebears' convictions? Or is their constant presence in your mind an endless burden that prevents you from making your own way in the world? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, History </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 122. </p>",
