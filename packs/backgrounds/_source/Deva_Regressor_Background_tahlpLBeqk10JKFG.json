They emerge to take charge of your body and mind, then assume your mind's rightful place. In this way, you regress to a former life, recalling events, people, and places from another time. Are you a willing participant in these events or do your past lives bully you? What major personalities are at home in your mind? What are they like when they take control? Are there any cues you can use to let your fellow players know when a different personality has taken control? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Perception </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 388. </p>",
