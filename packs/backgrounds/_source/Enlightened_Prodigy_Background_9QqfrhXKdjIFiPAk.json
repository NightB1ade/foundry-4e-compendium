			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Kalashtar, Psionic </p><p>As a child of a psychic race, it is unsurprising that you developed psionic power and chose to immerse yourself in its study. Your nature, culture, and faith encouraged you in this pursuit. But your fascination eclipsed the interests even of your fellow psionic kalashtar. How does your enlightened drive manifest now? Do you strive to perfect your abilities so you can fulfill your sacred duty to guide others toward a path of light and understanding? Or do you see yourself as superior to those you once studied with, forced to make your own way when they refuse to accept the superiority of your understanding? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Heal, Religion </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 123. </p>",
