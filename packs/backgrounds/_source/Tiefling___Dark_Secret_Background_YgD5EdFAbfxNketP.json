			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Tiefling </p><p>At some point in your past, you did something truly evil. You escaped punishment, but if you were ever to be identified as the perpetrator of that deed, you could still be put to death for it. Are you adventuring to forget the horror of your deed and stay away from those who still hunt you, or to try to atone for the wrong you committed? Whatever your crime, it was a clear demonstration of the evil of which you are capable because of the infernal taint in your soul. Will you transcend that evil, or will it ultimately claim you? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Dungeoneering </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 183. </p>",
