			"value":"<p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You are Vistani, but you, your family, or your clan is settled rather than nomadic. This is very atypical for the Vistani, so much so that itinerant Vistani refer to settled ones as \"dead.\" Was this lifestyle imposed upon you, as in the cases of exile or captivity? Is the cause just? Is it natural or supernatural? How was your relationship with the other settled natives of the area? Do you wish to return to the life of the road? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Insight, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 380, page(s) 81. </p>",
