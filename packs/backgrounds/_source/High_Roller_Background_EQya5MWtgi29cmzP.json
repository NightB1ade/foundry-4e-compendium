			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Adventurers </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>Fortune favors the bold, and sometime in the recent past, you took a big risk and came out ahead. Spending much of your time in Dawnside at the gambling clubs known as darren, you got to know the games well-at the table and away from it. You've always come up lucky when real coin's to be had, and you carry the heart of a gambler even when you're out adventuring far from home. </p><p>Recommended Feat: Darren Gambler </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 47. </p>",
