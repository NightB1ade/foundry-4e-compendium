			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>House Kundarak </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>You spent your youth guarding the countless underground vaults below Korunda Gate, the largest enclave of House Kundarak. Many of the vaults contain spectacular but mundane treasure: piles of gold, platinum, gems, and jewelry. Other vaults contain powerful weapons and armor-either legacies of bygone ages or examples of the best in modern dwarven craftsmanship. What wonders did you see in the chambers you guarded? Did you ever have to deal with thieves or raiders? Were you ever tempted to take something from the vaults-and did you resist the temptation? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, History </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 154. </p>",
