Indeed, tales tell of mad warlocks who traffic with alien entities, securing power from the stars themselves. As your mind has opened to new possibilities, you search the heavens for answers regarding your internal wellspring of psionic energy. You examine celestial movements for clues about the world's fate, and to perhaps catch a glimpse of the terrors that lurk between the twinkling lights. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, History </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 121. </p>",
