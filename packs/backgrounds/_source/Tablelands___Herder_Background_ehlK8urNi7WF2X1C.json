However, you are no dull shepherd-protecting your animals from desert predators and raiding tribes is a deadly serious task, and you learned to fight at an early age. Were you captured by slavers and taken from your people, or has some vendetta drawn you out into the wider world? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Endurance </p><p>Associated Languages: Thri-Kreen </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 184. </p>",
