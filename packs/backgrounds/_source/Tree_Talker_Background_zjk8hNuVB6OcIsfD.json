			"value":"<p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Follower of Melora </p><p>Your parents swear you could climb trees before you learned how to walk. You spent your childhood high in the branches, and for as long as you can remember, the trees whispered to you whenever the breeze moved through their leaves. Sometimes they would warn you of looming danger-a poisonous snake or a mountain cat. At other times, they shared secrets with you, such as who met secretly beneath the poplar the previous night. </p><p>Associated Quests: Find and renew a long-forgotten or defiled sacred grove; create a book of trees with names, descriptions, leaves, and pressed flowers of each of the sacred trees, including oak, ash, hawthorn, elm, apple, hazel, alder, elder, yew, holly, and willow. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 401. </p>",
