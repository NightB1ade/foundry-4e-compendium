You see the world in a very different way from others, and for that reason, people come from far and wide to seek your wisdom on matters of nature. You have read the spirits' signs and omens, and you know something is coming that no one is prepared for. You might be alone in this knowledge, but the fact that you have the knowledge suggests that you can help avert whatever disaster is imminent. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Nature </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 134. </p>",
