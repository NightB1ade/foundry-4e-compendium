What sort of confidence games did you favor-elaborate conspiracies, rigged games of chance, or ruses that facilitated traditional crimes like burglary, robbery, or kidnapping? How did you learn your trade? How close have you come to being caught? And how many enemies are out there, looking for a chance to get even? </p><p>Good Background: Halfling. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Bluff and Thievery to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Bluff and Thievery checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 56. </p>",
