What circumstances brought your ancestors to that plane? Were they natives of that plane, taken there against their will, or just visitors? When did you leave that plane, and what did you have to accomplish to escape it? Do you miss your birth plane, or do you dread returning to it? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 179. </p>",
